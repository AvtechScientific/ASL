# Media files

Some examples require input files (like .vti or .stl) that can be found in `examples/input_data`.

1. All .stl files were originally obtained from [GrabCAD](https://grabcad.com/) and are subject to their [Terms of Service](https://grabcad.com/terms); some of them were modified.

2. brain.vti was generated using  [BrainWeb](http://brainweb.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/brainweb/).

The rest of files, and specifically the images in `src/pics` are part of the ASL project and are covered by its license (see above) except where stated otherwise (`cmake/Modules`).
